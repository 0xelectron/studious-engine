2.  In lossy compression only a part of the original information is available back after the uncompression
    while in lossles compression all the original information is recovered after the uncompression.

6.  "stdint.h" header defines a set of integral type aliases with specific width requirements, along with macros specifying 
    their limits and macro functions to create values of these types.
7.  These data types allows us to use the specific size for an integer.
8.  1,4,4,2.
9.  The first two bytes of the BMP file format are the character 'B' then the character 'M' in 1-byte ASCII encoding.
10. bfSize is the size, in bytes, of the bitmap file while bisize is the number of bytes required by the "BITMAPINFOHEADER" structure.
11. biHeight is negative means the bitmap is a top-down DIB with the origin at the upper left corner.
12. biBitCount.
13. if the file does not exist then the pointer may return NULL.
14. because we need to read only one element at a time.

16. Sets the position indicator associated with the stream to a new position.
